## Basics

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1631560954399031296?s=20">Look beyond summary statistics for EDA</a>  -> Are you relying solely on summary statistics for your exploratory data analysis in Machine Learning projects? Here's why you shouldn't!

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1632267195723173888?s=20">The 'No Free Lunch' theorem</a>  -> If you think there's a perfect machine learning algorithm out there that can solve any problem, think again.

## MLOps

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1642377439715414017?s=20">Operational Databases, Data Lakes, and Data Warehouses</a>  -> Confused about the difference between operational databases, data lakes, and data warehouses? Here's a quick guide with examples to help you understand! A lemonade business analogy.

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1646018080953487360?s=20">Unit Test Vs Smoke Test</a>  -> Do you know what unit testing and smoke testing are? These are two important ways programmers make sure their code works properly.

<!-- Python -->
## Python

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1649015198962049024?s=20">Optimizing the Memory Usage of Dataframes</a>  -> Are you working with large datasets in Pandas? Optimizing the memory usage of your dataframes can help prevent memory errors. Here's a tip: try downcasting numerical columns to smaller data types! 

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1644554784853348352?s=20">Argparse</a>  -> Make your Python scripts more user-friendly with 'argparse' - the module that makes it easy to parse and handle command-line arguments! Bonus: Know how 'argparse' can help to streamline workflow as a Machine Learning engineer!

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1629708966556217345?s=20">Shallow copy Vs Deep copy</a>  -> Are you confused about the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python? Let's clear it up!

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1634842535909793793?s=20">Overview of Docstrings</a>  -> Writing clear and maintainable code is an important goal for any developer. One way to achieve this in Python is by using docstrings to document your functions!

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1651501333747486720?s=20">DataFrame.apply(), Zip, and Vectorization</a>  -> Need a faster alternative to df.apply() in Pandas? Try using vectorization or the zip method for faster and more efficient calculations.

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1635246134544453634?s=20">Numpy Tiled Arrays</a>  -> Want to repeat a NumPy array multiple times? With 'np.tile', you can quickly and easily create tiled arrays to suit your needs.

<a href="https://twitter.com/bhavsarkaustubh/status/1640952188439756802?s=20">DataFrame.apply() command</a>  -> If you're working with large datasets in pandas, for-loops can be slow and memory-intensive. DataFrame.apply() is a better option for optimizing your code and improving performance. See how to use it with both lambda and user-defined functions.
